            <h3>Caroline On My Mind</h3>
            <p>Checking for changes in here</p>

            <pre>
                Yeah
                Eric
    
                Well
    
                I don't need to lie no more
                Nowadays all I do is shine 
                Take a breath and ease my mind
                And she don't cry no more
                She tell me that I get her high
    
                'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
                ain't asking "Why?" no more
                Oh, no, I take it if it's mine
                I don't stay inside the lines
                It ain't 2009 no more
                Yeah, I know what's behind that door
    
                Yeah, okay you gotta jump in to swim
                Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
                Now every day I wake up and breathe
                I don't have it all but that's alright with me
                Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
    
                Send you back home with a light that's beaming
                The whole team about to figure it out
                We ice cold, that's what winter's about
                And sometimes, sometimes
                I wish I took a simpler route
    
                Instead of having demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
                Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
                'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kicking me out, yeah
                Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
                Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
    
                I was yea high and muddy
                Looking for what was looking for me
    
                But I don't need to lie no more
                Nowadays all I do is shine
                Take a breath and ease my mind
    
                And she don't cry no more
                She tell me that I get her high
                'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
                I ain't asking "Why?" no more
                Oh, no, I take it if it's mine
    
                I don't stay inside the lines
                It ain't 2009 no more
                Yeah, I know what's behind that door
    
                Yeah they ask me what I'm smiling for   
                Well, because I've never been this high before
    
                It's like I never felt alive before
                Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind and water
                See me and you, we ain't that different
                I struck the fuck out and then I came back swinging
    
                Take my time to finish, mind my business
                A life ain't a life 'til you live it
                I was digging me a hole big enough to bury my soul
                Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
                My own, with these songs I can carry you home
    
                I'm right here when you're scared and alone
                And I ain't ever in a hurry
                You don't never gotta worry
                Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
                When your heart get cold
    
                See what's behind all them unturned stones
                And I'm a pro when it comes to my job
                But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
                Now when it gets hard
                I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm
    
                Because I don't need to lie no more
                Nowadays all I do is shine
                Take a breath and ease my mind
                And she don't cry no more
                She tell me that I get her high
    
                'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
                I ain't asking "Why?" no more
                Oh, no, I take it if it's mine  
                I don't stay inside the lines
                It ain't 2009 no more
                Yeah, I know what's behind that door
    
                I don't need to lie no more
                Nowadays all I do is shine
                Take a breath and ease my mind
                And she don't cry no more
                She tell me that I get her high
    
                'Cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...
                I ain't asking "Why?" no more
                Oh, no, I take it if it's mine,
                I don't stay inside the lines
                It ain't 2009 no more
                Yeah, I know what's behind that door
